Main API for querying for movies/TV shows:
OMDb API
Note:
    - Use s=title to get multiple results, t=title to get a 
      specific movie result, or i=id to use the id to query
    - My API key is &apikey=5371282f which we should append
      to the end of every query we make to the OMDb API

Secondary API for querying for movies/TV shows:
The Movie Database API
https://www.themoviedb.org/
Note:
  - API key is ?api_key=b0011e93f013cfbed3110a3729a3e3c5
  - This allows us to query for things such as top rated movies,
    popular movies, etc.
